# Slack Terms of Service / Welcome message template

Sample Slack app that presents a Terms of Service (or any other message) when a new user joins a team.

The user can accept the Terms of Service using message buttons. If a user has been presented with the Terms before and they haven't accepted, a background job can send them a reminder after a specific period of time. Eventually you can use the SCIM API to disable the user's account.
