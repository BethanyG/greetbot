media-desc: "*Phillip Roberts*  _JavaScript programmers like to use words like, “event-loop”, “non-blocking”, “callback”, 'asynchronous', 'single-threaded' & 'concurrency'. We say things like 'don’t block the event loop', 'make sure your code runs at 60 frames-per-second', 'well of course, it won’t work, that function is an asynchronous callback!' If you’re anything like me, you nod and agree, as if it’s all obvious, even though you don’t actually know what the words mean; & yet, finding good explanations of how JavaScript actually works isn’t all that easy...so let’s learn!_"
