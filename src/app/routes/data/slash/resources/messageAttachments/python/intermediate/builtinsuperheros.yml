media-desc: "*David Beazley*  _One of the best live-coders ever & a *very* engaging speaker. He's been using Python for 20 years, & knows it inside & out. In this PyData Chicago 2016 Keynote, he performs live data cleaning & data science using *only the tools available in Python's core library*.  Amazing & humbling & very funny.  You'll never look at Chicago food ratings the same way again._"
