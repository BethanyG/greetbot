media-desc: "*David Beazley*  _Keynote at PyData Chicago 2016.  David Beazley is one of the best live-coders I've ever seen and is a very engaging speaker.  He's been using Python for 20 years, & knows it inside and out.  In this video, he performs data cleaning & data science using only the tools available in Python's core library.  Amazing & humbling & very funny.  You'll never look at Chicago food the same way again._"
