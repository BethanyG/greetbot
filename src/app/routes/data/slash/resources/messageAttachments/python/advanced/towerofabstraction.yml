media-desc: "*Alex Martelli: * leads tech support for Google Cloud & is the author of 'Python in a Nutshell' from O'Reilly.  _Abstraction is a powerful servant, but a dangerous master. We code, design, think, debug ... on a tower of abstractions. Spolsky's Law tells us that *All abstractions leak*. Alex explores why abstractions leak, why that's often a problem, & what you can do about it. He also covers why sometimes abstractions SHOULD 'leak' & how best to produce & consume abstraction layers._"
