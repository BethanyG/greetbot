media-desc: "*Alex Martelli* _Leads tech support for Google Cloud & wrote 'Python in a Nutshell' from O'Reilly. Abstraction is a powerful servant, but a dangerous master. We code, design, think, debug ... on a tower of abstractions. Spolsky's Law says *all abstractions leak*. Alex explores *why* they leak, why it's a problem, & what you can do about it. He also covers why sometimes abstractions *should* leak & how best to produce & consume abstraction layers._"
