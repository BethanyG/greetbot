media-desc: "(Free 10-day Trial Available) *Jessica McKellar*  _Head of development at Dropbox, & past organizer of the Boston Python User Group (one world's largest). During her time as an organizer, she taught hundreds of Python wannabees to happily program like pros. What do Scrabble cheaters, Shakespearean sonnets, Twitter, & the Astronomy Picture of the Day have to do with software programming? For Jessica, theyâ€™re playful tools for teaching intermediate-level Python techniques. She goes over those techniques for the next generation of Pythonistas in her follow-up to Introduction to Python._"
