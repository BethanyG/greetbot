media-desc: "(Through Edx.org, Self-paced & online) **MITx:**  _6.00.2x teachs how to use computation to accomplish a variety of goals & provides a brief introduction to a variety of topics in computational problem solving . It's aimed at students with some prior programming experience in Python & rudimentary knowledge of computational complexity (Big-O). You'll spend a considerable amount of implementing class concepts in code. Example problems include a program that simulates a robot vacuum cleaning a room, a model for the population dynamics of viruses replicating vs. drug treatments in a patient's body, & an algorithm to effectivley navigate the shortest path on the MIT campus in the snow._"
