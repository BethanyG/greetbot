media-desc: "(Edx.org, Self-paced & online) *MITx*  _This award-winning class teaches how to use computation to accomplish a variety of goals & provides a brief introduction to topics in computational problem solving. Some prior experience in Python & rudimentary knowledge of computational complexity (Big-O) recommended. You'll get considerable practice problem-solving & implementing class concepts in code. Examples include simulating a robot vacuum cleaner, modeling population dynamics of replicating viruses vs. drug treatments in a patient's body, & an algorithm to effectivley navigate the shortest path on the MIT campus in the snow._"
